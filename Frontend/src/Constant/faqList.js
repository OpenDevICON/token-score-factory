        ans: `<p>A token is a representation of something in blockchain. This something can be money, services, shares in a company or anything. By representing something as tokens, we can allow smart contract to interact with them.</p>
        <p>Tokens can be used to represent an investor's stake in the company or they can be used for an economic purpose, just like legal tender. This means token holders can use them to make purchases or they can trade tokens just like other securities to make a profit.</p>`
